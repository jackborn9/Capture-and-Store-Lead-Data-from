# How to Capture and Store Lead Data from Deadline Funnel Using a Custom Backend

If you're using Deadline Funnel to build urgency into your sales funnel, you're already ahead of the curve. But what if you want more control? What if you want to capture every lead that enters your funnel, store their data, and maybe even use it later for analysis or CRM integration?

You’re in the right place. In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to capture and store lead data from Deadline Funnel using your own custom backend. No fluff. Just actionable steps.

Let’s dive in.

---

## What Kind of Data Can You Capture from Deadline Funnel?

Deadline Funnel itself doesn’t store user data like names or emails. Instead, it works with your existing landing pages, email tools, and timers to add urgency. But with the right setup, you can track and save data like:

* Visitor's name and email
* Campaign ID or funnel name
* Deadline start and end time
* Device or location (if needed)
* Date and time of submission

Once you have this data, you can build powerful workflows and even automate follow-ups.

## Tools & Prerequisites

Before we get started, here’s what you’ll need:

* **Basic knowledge of JavaScript and backend APIs**
* **Node.js and Express.js** (or Python/Flask if you prefer)
* **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** (any database works)
* A Deadline Funnel account
* A landing page (can be HTML, WordPress, or funnel builder)

Optional tools:

* Zapier or Make.com (for CRM or email tool integration)
* Postman (for API testing)

## Step 1: Embed the Deadline Funnel Timer and Capture Lead Data

Start by setting up your landing page. Here’s what you’ll do:

1. **Embed the Deadline Funnel timer** using the script provided in your account.
2. **Create a lead capture form** on the page:

```html
<form id="lead-form">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
  <input type="hidden" name="campaign_id" value="df_campaign_123" />
  <button type="submit">Join Now</button>
</form>
```

3. **Add JavaScript** to fetch the Deadline Funnel deadline (optional if visible in the URL):

```js
const form = document.getElementById('lead-form');
form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const formData = new FormData(form);

  const lead = {
    name: formData.get('name'),
    email: formData.get('email'),
    campaign_id: formData.get('campaign_id'),
    submitted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  };

  await fetch('https://yourdomain.com/api/leads', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(lead),
  });
});
```

This will send the lead info to your backend when someone signs up.

---

## Step 2: Create a Backend API to Receive the Data

Let’s build the backend using **Node.js** and **Express**. First, create a project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
mkdir deadline-leads && cd deadline-leads
npm init -y
npm install express cors body-parser mongoose
```

Now, create your API server:

```js
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/deadlineleads', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});

const Lead = mongoose.model('Lead', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  campaign_id: String,
  submitted_at: Date
}));

app.post('/api/leads', async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, campaign_id, submitted_at } = req.body;

  if (!email || !campaign_id) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });
  }

  const lead = new Lead({ name, email, campaign_id, submitted_at });
  await lead.save();

  res.json({ message: 'Lead stored successfully' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

Run your server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Now your backend is ready to store leads into your local MongoDB.

## Step 3: Storing Data in a Database

In the example above, we used MongoDB, which is easy to set up. But you can also use MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Here’s a sample document structure in MongoDB:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "campaign_id": "df_campaign_123",
  "submitted_at": "2025-06-26T11:00:00Z"
}
```

Make sure to sanitize and validate inputs before saving to avoid spam or malformed data.

## Step 4: Auto-Sync Leads to Email Tools

Once a lead is stored, you can send it to your email platform using:

### Option 1: Zapier

* Set up a **Webhook trigger** in Zapier.
* Trigger on new entry to your API endpoint or MongoDB.
* Send lead to Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or any CRM.

### Option 2: Custom Code

Use an API request to sync lead data directly:

```js
const axios = require('axios');
await axios.post('https://api.convertkit.com/v3/forms/12345/subscribe', {
  email: lead.email,
  api_key: 'YOUR_CONVERTKIT_API_KEY'
});
```

This way, you keep everything automated and centralized.

---

## Step 5: Add Deadline Validation Logic (Optional)

Want to go deeper? You can calculate when a lead’s deadline expires.

If you store the timer start time:

```js
const deadlineStart = new Date(lead.submitted_at);
const deadlineEnd = new Date(deadlineStart.getTime() + (3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)); // 3-day timer
```

Now, check if the visitor’s deadline has passed when showing a thank-you or sales page.
This adds another layer of personalized urgency.

---

## Step 6: Secure and Test Everything

Make sure your API is secure:

* Use HTTPS
* Sanitize input
* Add rate limits or CAPTCHA to avoid spam
* Test using Postman

Also, check that every part of the flow works:

* Form submits properly
* API stores the data
* CRM sync is working

---

## Bonus: Display Captured Leads (Optional Admin Page)

You can create a simple admin page to view saved leads:

```js
app.get('/api/leads', async (req, res) => {
  const leads = await Lead.find().sort({ submitted_at: -1 });
  res.json(leads);
});
```

This can be useful if you want to monitor campaign performance.

---

## Use Cases for Capturing Lead Data

Why go through all this effort? Because it gives you superpowers:

* Segment leads by campaign or timer behavior
* Create smart follow-ups based on timer expiration
* Store user behavior for analytics
* Sync high-intent leads with CRM or retargeting tools

Plus, when you own the data, you have full freedom to use it however you want.

## Final Thoughts

Deadline Funnel is already a conversion powerhouse. But when you combine it with a custom backend, you unlock even more potential.

You can save every lead that enters your funnel, store critical campaign data, and automate everything—from emails to retargeting. And the best part? You’re not limited by platform rules or lack of integrations.

If you’re serious about growth, it’s time to build your own backend and take control of your funnel’s data.
